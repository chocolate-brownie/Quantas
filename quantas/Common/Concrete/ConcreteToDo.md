## **TO-DO List**

### 1. Use **Persistent TCP Connections**
**Goal:** Only connect to each peer once and reuse that connection.

**How:**
- Create a `PeerConnection` or `ConnectionManager` class.
- Store a persistent `int socket_fd` for each peer.
- Modify `send_json()` to:
  - Check if a socket exists and is connected
  - Otherwise, establish and store the connection

📝 *Avoids cost of connect/close per message.*

---

### 2. Push **accept() handling to thread pool**
**Goal:** Don’t block listener loop waiting on slow connections.

**How:**
- Inside `start_listener()`:
  ```cpp
  int client_fd = accept(...);
  pool.push_task([=] { handle_connection(client_fd); });
  ```
- Move message handling from inside the loop to a new `handle_connection()` function.

📝 *Improves scalability and responsiveness under load.*

---

### 3. Modularize Message Handling
**Goal:** Make message processing logic extensible and maintainable.

**How:**
- Declare:
  ```cpp
  std::unordered_map<std::string, std::function<void(const json&)>> handlers;
  ```
- Register handlers for `"ip_report"`, `"ip_list"`, `"message"`, etc.
- In your loop:
  ```cpp
  if (handlers.contains(type)) handlers[type](msg);
  ```

*Cleaner than `if-else-if` chains and easier to expand.*

---

### 4. Add a `PeerChannelManager` Layer
**Goal:** Cleanly manage per-peer persistent connections and their states.

**How:**
- Create a new class to:
  - Track `interfaceId → socket_fd`
  - Queue messages if disconnected
  - Attempt reconnection if broken
- Use this inside `unicastTo()` instead of calling `send_json()` directly

*Separates connection logic from protocol logic.*

---

### 5. Add **Message Stats / Logging**
**Goal:** Track messages sent, received, retries, failed sends.

**How:**
- Add counters (e.g. `std::atomic<int> sent_messages`) or use `OutputWriter::pushValue("stats", {...})`
- Print stats periodically or on shutdown

*Useful for performance tuning and debugging.*

---

### 6. Improve Error Checking on Socket Ops
**Goal:** Detect and diagnose hidden network bugs.

**Checklist:**
- `setsockopt()` → check return code
- `bind()` → check and throw on failure (you already do!)
- `send()` → check return value (`if (bytes_sent < 0)`)
- `recv()` / `read()` → handle `EINTR`, `EAGAIN`, `bytes == 0`
- Avoid swallowing exceptions in `catch (...)` — at least log them

*Improves safety, reliability, and log transparency.*

---

### 7. Log Malformed or Invalid JSON
**Goal:** Don’t silently ignore bad data.

**How:**
```cpp
catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr << "[JSON ERROR] " << e.what() << " Raw: " << raw_msg << "\n";
}
```

*Helps debug malformed packets or protocol mismatches.*

---

### 8. Clean Up Includes
**Goal:** Slim down the file and improve clarity.

**How:**
- Remove unused headers like `<deque>`, `<algorithm>` if not used.
- Consider creating a common `socket_util.hpp` for shared TCP code.

---

### 9. Use an RAII Wrapper for Sockets
**Goal:** Avoid manually closing sockets in every branch.

**How:**
```cpp
class ScopedSocket {
public:
    explicit ScopedSocket(int fd) : fd(fd) {}
    ~ScopedSocket() {
        if (fd >= 0) close(fd);
    }
    int fd;
};
```
Use:
```cpp
ScopedSocket sock(accept(...));
```

*Reduces bugs and ensures sockets always close cleanly.*

---

## Reliability & Safety – In Detail

### Why These Matter

**In a distributed simulation**, one bad socket or missed error check can:
- Cause peer hangs
- Fail silently on message delivery
- Delay reconnections
- Leave ports stuck in `TIME_WAIT` or `CLOSE_WAIT`

### Key Issues and Fixes

| Issue | Risk | Fix |
|-------|------|-----|
| `bind()` fails | Port can't be reused → hangs | Already fixed by throwing |
| `send()` fails silently | Messages lost, peer unaware | Log and reconnect socket |
| `recv() == 0` | Peer closed connection | Clean up or reconnect |
| Swallowed exception in `catch (...)` | All errors ignored | Log with `what()` and message dump |
| No retry limit in `connect()` | Infinite retry loops | Add timeout or max attempts |
| All logic in main loop | Spaghetti bugs, hard to trace | Move logic to handler map or dispatcher |
| No backpressure | Flooded queues, memory growth | Track pending tasks and slow sender |

## Notes

these steps will:
- Improve robustness and observability
- Future-proof the architecture
- Make it easier to scale to 10s or 100s of nodes
